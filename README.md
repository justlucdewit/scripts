# Lukes script repository
A package of handy bash tools/command for software development and personal purposes.

I created these scripts because I love automating my life at work and my personal administration. Feel free to use and even modify these scripts.

They are mainly written to be used in WLS2 Ubuntu, but I am planning to make it work on any system that supports bash out of the box.

LSR is easy to use, compiles itself, and can automatically be installed/updated/deinstalled.
